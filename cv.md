## **About me**

I started my journey of studying front-end development 3 years ago, when I was looking for answers to the questions -  "what kind of job would I like to get up in the morning, and what would I do in it?". After a long study of various vacancies on a job search site, the choice fell on the front-end.


After learning the basics of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JS, I was faced with the reality that this was no longer enough to get a Junior position, so I dove into deep learning of JavaScript. In parallel with my studies, I also gained experience working in technical support in the telecommunications industry, where I improved my knowledge of networks and learned how the Internet works in general.


At RS School I want to gain practical experience and consolidate theoretical knowledge.


## **Skills:**

* HTML5
* CSS
* SCSS
* BEM
* Responsive design
* JavaScript
* React JS (core)
* Git
* webpack, npm
* Linux

## **Code Examples:**

```

  let b = 1;
  while (true) {
    let c = a * b;
    yield `${a} x ${b++} = ${c}`;
  }
}
```


## **Work Experience:**

To practice coding and understand how to add dynamics to a web page using pure JavaScript, I created a website for an eSports club. You can view the code at [this link](https://github.com/farmer206/slashplay/tree/main).


After that, I needed to close the knowledge gaps about network technologies. I got a job at an Internet provider company, where they explained to me what an IP address is (private, public), DNS, how switching and routing equipment works. We taught how to configure switches (Cisco, LinkSys, Eltex, TP-link, D-link) and much more.
